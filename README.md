**Getting Started**

- Find a project 

#### Looking for a project can be very daunting since. We decided on making a calendar because the layout and design of it is not complicated and we can focus on our API and crud functionality
- Create a wireframe

#### Creating a wireframe for this project is estential since there are so many componenets in a calendar. We created a wireframe using adobe XD. By doing this we learned how to create the perfect Grid template for this project. 

- Create a planning directory

#### The planning directory inculdes a list of models we used in the calendar as well as a picture of our entire wireframe.

**Working as a Group**

##### Creating a fullstack MERN project from scartch is difficult as a team when without a plan As a group we needed to use the feature branch workflow so each person in the group can be as efficient as possible in making a calendar. We used an efficient workflow to split up the process and make time use very efficient.


-- Learning how to git pull effectively

#### Pulling fellow teammates code in the same file took a lot of learning as well as
